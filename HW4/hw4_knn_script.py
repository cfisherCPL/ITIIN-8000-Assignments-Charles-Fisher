# import the iris dataset from sklearn to do data stuff to it
# import the knn classifier to be used for classification of data
# import train_test_split from sklearn to split our dataset
# import metrics from sklearn to test accuracy

# load the iris dataset
# put the features in an object called X

# put the responses in an object called y

# instantiate the classifier with a K value

# split the data into training and testing sets

# fit the model using the split training data

# feed the testing set into the knn object

# test the accuracy of the output of the test set vs the training set
